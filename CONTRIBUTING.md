# Contributing

Contributions are very welcome!

## Feature Requests & Bug Reports
For feature requests and bug reports, [submit an issue][issues].

## Pull Requests
The preferred way to contribute is to fork the [main repository][repository] on GitHub.

1. Discuss your proposed change in a GitHub issue first before spending time and implementing a feature or fix.

2. Ensure all changes are relevant to the pull request. Keep pull requests as small and to-the-point as possible.

3. Add & modify tests as necessary. Also, ensure the code matches the existing style.

4. Once changes are completed, open a pull request for review against the master branch.
