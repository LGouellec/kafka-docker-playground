### Create a new Connected App

Full details available [here](https://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/kafka-connect-salesforce/pushtopics/salesforce_pushtopic_source_connector_quickstart.html#salesforce-account)

Steps are:

* Click the *New Connected App* button in the upper right corner of the Setup panel.

* Supply a Connected App Name, API Name, and Contact Email.

* Select *Enable OAuth Settings* checkbox and select the *Enable for Device Flow* checkbox. These selections enable the connector to use the Salesforce API.
* Under the *Select OAuth Scopes* field, select all of the items under Available OAuth scopes and add them to the *Selected OAuth Scopes*.

Example:

* Save the new app and press Continue at the prompt.
* Look for the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret in the displayed form. Save these so you can put them in the configuration properties file for the Salesforce connect worker.

**IMPORTANT !!**: for new orgs, "Username-Password Flow" is disabled by default, see the [help page](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_security_username-password_flow_blocked_by_default.htm&release=244&type=5).

You need to activate this (otherwise you get `{"error":"invalid_grant","error_description":"authentication failure"}`):
