# Fully Managed Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 Sink connector



## Objective

Quickly test [Fully Managed Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 Sink](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/cc-azure-datalakeGen2-storage-sink.html) connector.



## Prerequisites

All you have to do is to be already logged in with [confluent CLI](https://docs.confluent.io/confluent-cli/current/overview.html#confluent-cli-overview).

By default, a new Confluent Cloud environment with a Cluster will be created.

You can configure the cluster by setting environment variables:

* `CLUSTER_CLOUD`: The Cloud provider (possible values: `aws`, `gcp` and `azure`, default `aws`)
* `CLUSTER_REGION`: The Cloud region (use `confluent kafka region list` to get the list, default `eu-west-2` for aws, `westeurope`for azure and `europe-west2` for gcp)
* `CLUSTER_TYPE`: The type of cluster (possible values: `basic`, `standard` and `dedicated`, default `basic`)
* `ENVIRONMENT` (optional): The environment id where want your new cluster (example: `txxxxx`) 

In case you want to use your own existing cluster, you need to setup these environment variables:

* `ENVIRONMENT`: The environment id where your cluster is located (example: `txxxxx`) 
* `CLUSTER_NAME`: The cluster name
* `CLUSTER_CLOUD`: The Cloud provider (possible values: `aws`, `gcp` and `azure`)
* `CLUSTER_REGION`: The Cloud region (example `us-east-2`)
* `CLUSTER_CREDS`: The Kafka api key and secret to use, it should be separated with colon (example: `<API_KEY>:<API_KEY_SECRET>`)
* `SCHEMA_REGISTRY_CREDS` (optional, if not set, new one will be created): The Schema Registry api key and secret to use, it should be separated with colon (example: `<SR_API_KEY>:<SR_API_KEY_SECRET>`)


## How to run

Simply run:

```
$ just use <playground run> command
```

Note if you have multiple [Azure subscriptions](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs-cli/blob/main/docs-ref-conceptual/manage-azure-subscriptions-azure-cli.md#change-the-active-subscription) make sure to set `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME` environment variable to create Azure resource group in correct subscription (for confluent support, subscription is `COPS`).
